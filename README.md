Title: Pinned!

Description: The application will ultimately strive to exist as the first mainstream social media tailored to leverage user location as              opposed to user thoughts, pictures, information, or video. The user will be able to place a pin on his or her personal map              in desired location, viewable by those allowed to view the user's pin, set by the user. The pin can hold a description and              a picture or video, along with the implication to go to the pin at a later time. If the user desires to meet with his or                her friends at the pin that was placed, they have the ability to set a meeting.

Vision statement: Our goal is to make catching up with your friends and local community as easy as possible. By allowing users to take                     advantage of geolocator based notifications and events users can easily organize for meet ups or put                                     notes/pictures/videos for others at any location.

Motivation: One of the group members, Tyler Albee, has been working on the design process of this app for a few months now, and we're               all interested in learning the app making process, from start to finish. This app would allow for a much more immersive                 social media interaction as any person could instantly relate to the areas around them, by having notifications geolocation             based it would make setting up times and places to meet with your friends incredibly easy, compared to the competitors. 

Risks: This project is a very large undertaking, and could certainly be biting off more than we can chew. However, dividing our work            into sprints will help us to move the mountain one shovel full at a time. It will be a bit difficult collaborating efficiently as        a group when we are all very busy students. 

Mitigation strategy for dealing with the risk: We are going to divide work as well as we possibly can, and use all of the resources we                                                  have available to us here at CU to help us deal with problems we don't know how to solve. 

List of requirements: for the project
6 user stories
Each story must have a unique ID number
Written in the Agile format: “As a [role], I want to [do X] so that I can [benefit with Y]”
Each requirement must have a size. You have two options for sizing:
Agile sizing – story points
Time estimate to complete
All stories should be sized to be completed in less than 8 hours (approximately, and something equivalent to a day or less in Agile story points). If your story is bigger than that, then break it up into smaller stories.

[optional] you can add priority (Critical, High, Med, Low, Nice-to-have)
[optional] you can add topic/area (e.g., Login, Profile, DB, etc.)
[optional] you can add user type (e.g., Admin, end user, potential customer,…)
Methodology: Which methodology you plan to follow, though it may change: Waterfall, iterfall, Agile, mash-up of …
Project Tracking software:
Name of the software you will use
Trello is most common
Pivotal Tracker
Basecamp
GitHub Issues & Milestones
Link to project tracking software: make sure instructor and TAs have access
Be sure to continue to use this throughout the semester! Even though these are small projects, the point is to practice the methodologies and tools used in industry!
Project plan: created from your Project Tracking software. Copy-paste the plan (or screenshot of) from your project tracking software into the repository.
